# My Educational Journey

From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by the beauty of numbers and the intricate patterns they reveal. This passion led me to pursue a **Bachelor of Science in Mathematics** at **Jadavpur University, Kolkata**, where I dived deep into foundational concepts like Linear Algebra, Probability, and Calculus. Graduating with an impressive 81%, I felt ready to take on the world of mathematics, but I wanted to do more. I wanted to bridge the gap between theory and real-world applications.

This desire for practical impact took me to the **Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science**, where I completed my **Post Graduate in Mathematics and Computing**. Here, I honed my skills in advanced subjects like **Machine Learning, NLP, and Graph Theory**, earning a CGPA of 9.1. I found myself particularly drawn to the growing world of Data Science and AI, where mathematical principles could be applied to solve complex, real-world challenges. I realized that the algorithms and models I learned could make a tangible difference across industries, and I was hooked.

To further refine my expertise, I joined the **International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore**, where I am currently pursuing an **Executive Post Graduate in Data Science & AI**. This program is not just a continuation of my academic journey but a platform to merge my foundational knowledge in mathematics with cutting-edge AI technologies. Every course, every project, is an opportunity to contribute to the rapidly evolving field of data science and AI, and I’m excited to see where this path leads me.
